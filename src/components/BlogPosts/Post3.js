          <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>When you send an SMS, a lot of people read it quickly. Studies say more than
            90% of text messages are opened in just a few minutes. This means your
            message is more likely to be seen by the people you want to see it.

          <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>SMS messages get to people almost instantly. This is great for things that are
            important or need to happen fast. Your audience gets the information quickly and
            can act on it right away.

          <span className='text-primaryText'> People Engage More:</span>

          <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>SMS marketing often gets more responses. People are more likely to do
            something after getting a text compared to emails or other messages. You can
            ask people to do things like click a link or buy something, and they might do it
            right away.
          </p>

          <span className='text-primaryText'>Not Expensive:</span>

          <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>SMS marketing doesn't cost a lot compared to other ways of advertising. Sending
            lots of text messages is usually cheaper. This is good for businesses with not
            much money, especially small and medium-sized ones.

          <span className='text-primaryText'>People Choose to Get Messages:</span>

          <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>In SMS marketing, people choose to get your messages. This means they are
            interested in what you have to say. Also, you can make your messages personal
            and fit what your customers like.

          <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>Almost everyone has a mobile phone. SMS marketing helps you talk to a big and
            diverse group of people. No matter how old they are or where they live, SMS
            messages can connect with a wide range of customers. It's a good way to
            include lots of different people in your marketing.

    </p>
    <p className='font-[500] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>Even though SMS marketing is great, it's important to use it in a good way and respect
      people's privacy. Always ask for permission before sending SMS messages and give
      people the option to stop getting them. This helps make sure your SMS marketing is
      positive and follows the rules.

          customers more involved.
        </p>

        <p className='font-[500] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>SMS (Short Message Service) marketing is a strong tool that businesses
use to talk to their audience through text messages.

          <ul className='lg:ml-10 number-bullet  text-secondaryText gap-3 flex flex-col'>
            <li>
              <span className='text-primaryText'>Lots of People Open Them:</span> 
              <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>When you send an SMS, a lot of people read it quickly. Studies say more than
                90% of text messages are opened in just a few minutes. This means your
                message is more likely to be seen by the people you want to see it.

                important or need to happen fast. Your audience gets the information quickly and
                can act on it right away.

              <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>SMS marketing often gets more responses. People are more likely to do
                something after getting a text compared to emails or other messages. You can
                ask people to do things like click a link or buy something, and they might do it
                right away.

            <li>

              <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>SMS marketing doesn't cost a lot compared to other ways of advertising. Sending
                lots of text messages is usually cheaper. This is good for businesses with not
                much money, especially small and medium-sized ones.

              <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>In SMS marketing, people choose to get your messages. This means they are
                interested in what you have to say. Also, you can make your messages personal
                and fit what your customers like.
              </p>

              <p className='text-[16px] font-[600] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>Almost everyone has a mobile phone. SMS marketing helps you talk to a big and
                diverse group of people. No matter how old they are or where they live, SMS
                messages can connect with a wide range of customers. It's a good way to
                include lots of different people in your marketing.
              </p>

          </ul>
        </p>
        <p className='font-[500] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>Even though SMS marketing is great, it's important to use it in a good way and respect
people's privacy. Always ask for permission before sending SMS messages and give
people the option to stop getting them. This helps make sure your SMS marketing is
positive and follows the rules.

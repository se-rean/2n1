        <span className='lg:ml-10 font-[500] tracking-wide leading-7 text-secondaryText'>During the pandemic, the world faced uncertainty, causing chaos in every country. The fear of illness affected everyone. However, amidst this, businesses had to rethink their economic strategies. One emerging role gaining popularity is that of a virtual assistant.

        So, what is a virtual assistant? They are remote experts who provide digital assistance. In today's digital era, where social media is crucial for businesses, virtual assistants make things easier for business owners.

        For startups building an online presence, a virtual assistant is a game-changer. Need a logo? A virtual assistant skilled in graphic design has got you covered. Want to boost brand awareness and identity? A virtual assistant with expertise in social media management can work magic, giving your business the popularity it needs.
